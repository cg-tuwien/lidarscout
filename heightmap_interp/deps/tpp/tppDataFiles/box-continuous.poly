# points will always be continuous, either clockwise or anti-clockwise, inner-shape will always return to entry point
# inner spape can spawn another inner shape, but will always be to the outside of it's own boundary
# all inner shapes will be contained within the outermost boundary
# output : inner shapes are supposed to be holes
