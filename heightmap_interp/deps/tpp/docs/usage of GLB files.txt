GLB files are useful in scenarios that require animation and motion, or when there is a desire for interactivity. 
Those situations include:

 - Video game developers can save their work as GLB files.

 - Interactive websites and ads use the GLB format to display objects that users can interact with (like a couch that 
   they can rotate and view from any angle).

 - AR and VR developers can also save their work in the format.
