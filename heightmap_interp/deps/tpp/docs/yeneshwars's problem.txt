Hello Marek, 

Hope you are feeling much better now and all is well with you and your family.

I have actually managed to solve the issue I had; those straight lines you see in the graphic are coincident and overlap which is 
why triangulation would fail. I managed to sanitize the input before triangulation.

But I did run into another issue, I tried to get a screenshot, but since it has been a while, I wasn't able to recreate it.

Let's say you have two separate segments overlapping each other ( one exactly on top of the other ) and also two separate hole 
points within the segments that overlap each other; triangulation fails.

I use your library as part of parsing Gerber files and triangulating them to create Draco encoded .glb files.
